In this project our aim is to create a generic wrapper for a user defined function to give it a cache with a user-\/selected policy for replacement, i.\+e L\+RU, M\+FU, M\+RU, L\+FU, Random etc. The wrapper returns a function object which can then be used by the user to make multiple calls to their function and when repeated calls are made, the system uses its cache rather than recalculating the value again.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{How to Execute the Project\+:}\label{index_autotoc_md4}

Our project makes extensive use of Modern C++ programming techniques. Our code uses C++20 features such as concepts and better compile time types deduction. We have also made use of extensive compile time programming and checks to ensure that we are able to achieve a zero-\/abstraction overhead for the user and they only pay for what they use, which in our case is extra space for the cache and extra computation for the cache lookup and eviction policy. ~\newline
 The user can also use pointer types with our cache provided they use a {\ttfamily shared\+\_\+ptr$<$T$>$} so that the pointer does not dangle until the the elements are removed from the cache or the cache goes out of scope and the user does not hold the {\ttfamily shared\+\_\+ptr$<$T$>$}. This ensures no cache leaks on part of the user and cache, while taking advantage of the caching infrastructure.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Caching Overheads\+:}\label{index_autotoc_md7}

In this project we have created a generic cache wrapper for user defined functions. The wrapper also provides the user with the choice of selecting the size of and eviction policy of the cache. We also demonstrated that the cached wrapped version of the user defined function was faster than the non cache wrapped version of the same function across various types of test cases, cache sizes and cache eviction policies. The implementation uses modern C++ (here C++20) features and takes advantage of compile time programming in order to make sure that the generated code is exactly what the user required.
